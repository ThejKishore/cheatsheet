### Notes

1. **Availability**: The availability in East US and Central US is based on standard Azure offerings, but it's always good to check the Azure portal or pricing calculator for real-time availability.
2. **Monthly Cost Estimates**: Costs can vary based on region, reserved instance pricing, and actual usage. The costs are estimated based on typical pricing and may change.
3. **Regional Variability**: Some sizes may have limited availability in certain regions or require specific configurations (e.g., availability zones).
